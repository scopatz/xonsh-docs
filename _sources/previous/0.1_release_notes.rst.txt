Xonsh 0.1 Release Notes
=============================
xonsh is a Python-ish, BASHwards-compatible shell language and command prompt.
The language is a superset of Python 3.4 with additional shell primitives
that you are used to from BASH and IPython. xonsh is 
meant for the daily use of experts and novices alike.

Features include:

* Naturally typed environment variables
* Inherits the environment from BASH
* Uses BASH completion for subprocess commands
* Regular expression filename globbing
* Its own PLY-based lexer and parser
* xonsh code parses into a Python AST
* You can do all the normal Python things, like arithmetic and importing
* Captured and uncaptured subprocesses
* Pipes, redirection, and non-blocking subprocess syntax support
* Help and superhelp with ? and ??
* Command aliasing
* Multiline input, unlike ed
* History matching like in IPython
* Color prompts
* Low system overhead

Feedback, bug reports, and pull requests are always welcome!
